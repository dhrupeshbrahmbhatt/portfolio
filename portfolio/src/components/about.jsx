                        Hello! My name is Dhrupesh and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web 
                        development started back in 2020 when i decided to try edit my Thumblr themes -- turns out hacking 
                        together a custom reblog botton taught me a lot about HTML & css!

                        Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge 
                        corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive 
                        products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.
